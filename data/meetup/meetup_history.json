        "description": "This first meeting will be your opportunity to help shape the direction for this group.<br /><br />With recent exposure in the NY Times, R is become less of an obscure tool confined to academia. The R-SIG-Finance list is full of New Yorkers who apply R in financial settings. Inside Google, Facebook and other data intensive companies, R plays an important role in helping analysts understand ecosystems. <br /><br />And R can be a lot of fun to use too. A powerful, and sometimes painful, mix of functional, imperative and object-oriented programming - the learning curve is steep and many things don't work as one would expect. Given this, I find it terribly useful to keep in touch with other R programmers as I'm always learning new tricks and improving my skills.<br /><br />Meeting Agenda:<br /><br />1. Introduction to R <br />2. Machine Learning in R  <br />3. Whit Armstrong will talk about his Financial Time Series package<br />4. Suggestions for future meetings discussion<br />5. General R Q&amp;A<br /><br />I hope to see you there.<br />",

        "description": "Jay Emerson and Michael Kane; Yale University - Department of Statistics, will go through the basics of R's package system, and will demonstrate the process of creating, checking, and building a simple package.  <br /><br />The talk will touch upon the use of S3 and S4 (if you don't know about them, don't worry about it) and the inclusion of C/C++ code (if you're not into C/C++, don't worry about it).  As time permits, the presenters may introduce a range of additional topics, such as (a) the difference between .C() and .Call(), (b) our approach to handling massive matrices (potentially exceeding available RAM, and potentially shared across R processes), or (c) very elegant tools for parallel computing (package &quot;foreach&quot; by Steve Weston).  Each of these latter topics relate to package design in interesting ways.<br /><br /><b>Note</b>: given the success of the pre-meetup networking at the February meetup, we will again have some coffee and snacks starting at 6:15pm, and the talks will begin promptly at 7pm.  As before, we are asking for a donation of $5.00 from each member to cover the cost of catering.  You may make your donation now using PayPal, or in cash at the meetup.<br />",

        "description": "Thanks again to Shane for suggesting this meetup topic!<br /><br /><b>UPDATE</b>: Before the applications talks begin, we will be hearing from Geoff Lewis of <a href=\"https://www.topguest.com/gate\" target=\"_blank\">TopGuest.com</a> about his start-up, their data, and opportunities to join their team. <br /><br />This meetup with cover several examples of how R can be used across a wide range of research fields.  Each presenter will discuss their topic for 10-15 minutes, and then the audience will have an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback.<br /><br /><ul><br /><li> Pankaj Chopra - using R and Bioconductor (<a href=\"http://www.bioconductor.org/docs/install/\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"http://www.bioconductor.org/docs/install/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bioconduct...</a></a>) for biomarker detection in cancer<br /><li> Andrew Ilardi - an R project that analyzes a list of stocks while reaching out to the web to pull their historical prices, then plots Quarter over Quarter correlations and a year over year scatter plot.<br /><li> Jared Lander - analyzing data from 30 countries in the World Health Survey that were the result of a comprehensive look at the lives of thousands of people in each country, we fit multilevel models using lmer() to model and display the differing affect wealth has on the probability of contracting Noncommunicable Diseases at differing levels of development.  Jared will also be sharing his research on <a href=\"http://www.jaredlander.com/wordpress/wordpress-2.9.2/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Pizza-Thesis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">finding the best pizza in NYC</a>, and how he used R in this research.<br /><li> Andrew Little - often in game theory (and presumably other applied math settings) we are interested in the behavior of equations with no explicit solution. I will demonstrate how I use the optim() and other functions in R for such situations in my research<br /><li> John Myles White - use of R for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human brain, and review the basic ideas behind fMRI analysis and show how it can be easily implemented in R using only default functions.<br /></ul><br /><br />As you can see, quite an eclectic assortment of topics that I am sure everyone will find interesting.  Thanks to all of the speakers for volunteering.  We will have the usual networking time starting at 6:15pm and speakers will begin promptly at 7:00pm.<br /><br />See you in April!<br />",

        "description": "<a href=\"http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cocteau/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Hansen</a> -- on sabbatical at the New York Times R&amp;D Group from the Department of Statistics, UCLA -- will talk about the use of R for teaching data analysis at both the undergraduate and high school levels. The talk will draw on recent experiences with the Los Angeles Unified School District and the design of a six-week data analysis unit within a year-long computer science curriculum. While the talk is framed around problems related to teaching, it involves themes and data types that are not typically discussed in an introductory statistics class. <br /><br />Broadly, the unit is designed as a kind of &quot;participatory sensing&quot; exercise. Participatory sensing is a variation on traditional embedded sensing that enlists the efforts of the general public to collect and analyze data. In our case, Google has generously donated a number of G2 phones that students use to capture geo-tagged and timestamped observations. From a practical perspective, the talk surveys R packages for representing, visualizing and modeling data on time and location, as well as images and text. Students in the unit learn a kind of story telling with fairly complex data -- An activity that is not entirely distinct from traditional statistics, but, given the unit's position within a computer science course, emphasizes computation over mathematics, information technology and the &quot;mechanics of data&quot; over probability and analytical approximations.<br /><br />Finally, Mark will discuss how this work has been extended to other outlets for this kind of story telling, and include a presentation of a number of public art works that draw on data feeds. These include Moveable Type, a permanent artwork in the lobby of the New York Times Building; and <a href=\"http://stewdio.org/work/terrenatale/\" target=\"_blank\">Terre Natale</a>, and a recent commission by the Cartier Foundation on the theme of global migration.<br />",

While originally I intended this meetup to also address data types and vectorizied operation, upon the sage advise of fellow members I have decided to table those topics for a future meetup.<br /><br />As such, the scheduled topics and speakers for June are:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Debugging basics - Jay Emerson will review basic core functions for simple debugging, including print(), cat() and browser()<br /><li>Advanced debugging - Harlan Harris will build on Jay's introduction and provide an interactive introduction to more advanced debugging techniques using traceback(), trace() and debug()<br /><li>Using the REvo IDE for debugging - Joseph Rickerts of <a href=\"http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">REvolution Analytics</a> will provide a brief tutorial on using their IDE for debugging<br /><li>Demystifying error messages - Finally, Peter Flom will discuss several error messages he has run into while learning R, provide some replication code, and go over where they come from and how to avoid them.<br /></ul><br /><br />As is tradition, we will provide some light catering starting at 6:15pm, and invite everyone to arrive early to have a snack and do some networking with your fellow data nerds before the taks.  Speakers will begin promptly at 7pm, which will be followed by informal beeR gathering at a local watering hole for those that can stay.<br />",

        "description": "We have our speakers!  Thank you to everyone who has volunteered to talk about using R to explore open data.  You will find the schedule below, but I would like to highlight two changes to our normal operating procedures for this month.<br /><br />First, as with previous meetups with multiple speakers, each speaker will have fifteen minutes to present.  In an effort to maintain a tighter schedule, however, this month we will be <b>keeping talks to exactly 15 minutes</b>.  Speakers will be given 5 and 1 minute warnings---just like a conference!  Second, because fifteen minutes is not a lot of time to discuss the technical aspects of the analysis, we will be experimenting with a &quot;<i>How'd They Do That</i>&quot; portion of the meetup.  After the talks, presenters will break off into smaller groups and have a chance to discuss the actual R code used to produce their analysis; take questions, and provide further examples.  My hope is that this will give people a chance to ask more specific questions and interact with presenters.<br /><br /><u>Schedule</u>:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>6:15pm-7pm: NetwoRking (with refreshments)<br /><li>7pm-8pm: Presentations<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Sean Goggins: Evolution of discourse centered networks in MyLyn Eclipse Plugin<br /><li>Ronald Calitri: Population nutrition in Iraq districts modeled from international data<br /><li>WikiLeaks Team - Multiple analyses of WikiLeaks Afghan War Diaries data by Mike Dewar, Harlan Harris, John Myles White and Drew Conway<br /></ul><br /><li>8pm-the bar: How'd they do that?<br /></ul><br /><br /><br />There is room for one more presenter, so if you would like to give a short talk on something you are working on in R with open data please let me know.

        "description": "This month we are very lucky to have Prof. Andrew Gelman, Statistics, Columbia University, presenting some of his most recent research.  Below is a brief description of Prof. Gelman's talk:<br /><br /><i>A challenge in statistics is to construct models that are structured enough to be able to learn from data but not be so strong as to overwhelm the data. We introduce the concept of weakly informative priors which contain important information but less than may be available for the given problem at hand. We also discuss some related problems in developing general models for interactions. We consider how these ideas apply to problems in social science and public health. All the work for these projects was done in R.</i><br /><br />The schedule for this meetup will follow our usual format: networking with refreshments starting at 6:15pm, then Prof. Gelman will begin at 7pm.<br />",

Chris has been kind enough to offer to present his work on Bayesian estimation using MCMC, despite the fact that he will no doubt be exhausted from having run a marathon the day before.<br /><br />Chris is one of the co-creators of <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pymc/\" target=\"_blank\">PyMC</a>, the premier package for MCMC estimation in Python. From PyMC's website:<br /><br /><i>Bayesian estimation, particularly using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is an increasingly relevant approach to statistical estimation. However, few statistical software packages implement MCMC samplers, and they are non-trivial to code by hand. PyMC is a python module that implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a python class, and is extremely flexible and applicable to a large suite of problems. PyMC includes methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence diagnostics.</i><br /><br />You'll note that this presentation <b>does not directly involve R</b>, and there are a couple of reasons for this:<br /><br /><ul type=\"1\" class=\"fakeOL\"><br /><li>Chris has greatly contributed to the statistical computing community, and we are lucky to have him<br /><li>Given the <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2010/09/ross_ihaka_to_r.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent consternation within the R community</a> about the language, it is valuable to understand how other languages approach statistical computing<br /><li>We always say the R meetup is the satellite Python meetup, and now we can make that official.  I have also invited the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/nycpython/\">Python users group</a> to this meetup, and I hope it will be an opportunity for these communities to mingle.<br /></ul><br /><br />Chris is going to send me a brief description of his talk in the coming days, and I will update this announcement when I receive it.  <br /><br />Finally, depending on time and interest level, I may also present a brief follow-up to Chris's talk on integrating R with PyMC using some of the various tools that exist to bridge R to Python.<br /><br />Please let me know if you have any questions.<br />",

Ni Wang and Max Lin (currently at Google), and Mark Ko (former intern) will discuss their work at Google, and how they use R to analyze data.  Below is a description of their talk:<br /><br /><i>Data plays a central role at Google.  R is one of the important tools used by analysts and engineers at Google for analyzing data. In the talk, we will first show a few examples on how R is currently used at Google to solve some analytical problems. We then discuss how R has gained its popularity in both analysts and engineering communities. In the second half of the talk, we discuss our plans to make R more integrated with internal machine learning algorithms and infrastructure. We will introduce an R client library for the Google Prediction API,  which is a machine learning web service running on the cloud.</i><br /><br />Please note that we are <b>switching locations again</b>, and will be meeting at AOL headquarters downtown.<br /><br />Finally, I have listed the time as 7pm, which is when the talk will begin.  As usual, however, I will have pizzas delivered about 6:15pm and everyone is welcome to join for some netwoRking.<br /><br />Hope to see you in December!<br />",

        "description": "<p>This month we are incredibly excited to host <a href=\"http://had.co.nz/\">Hadley Wickham</a>,&nbsp;Assistant Professor of Statistics at Rice University, and creator of many of the most popular R packages in CRAN.</p>\n<p>It's often said that 80% of the effort of analysis is spent just getting the data ready to analyse, the process of data cleaning. Data cleaning is not only a vital first step, but it is oftenrepeated multiple times over the course of an analysis as new problems come to light. Despite the amount of time it takes up, there has been little research on how to do clean data well. Part of the challenge is the breadth of activities that cleaning encompasses, from outlier checking to date parsing to missing value imputation. To get a handle on the problem, this talk focusses on a small, but important, subset of data cleaning that I call data \"tidying'\": getting the data in a format that is easy to manipulate, model, and visualise. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this talk you'll see some of the crazy data sets that I've struggled with over the years, and learn the basic tools for making messy data tidy. I'll also discuss tidy tools, tools that take tidy data as input and return tidy data as output. The idea of a tidy tool is useful for critiquing existing R functions, and will help to explain why some tasks that seem like they should be easy are in fact quite hard. This work ties together <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html\">reshape2</a>, <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/\">plyr</a> and <a href=\"http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/\">ggplot2</a> with a consistent philosophy of data. Once you master this data format, you'll find it much easier to manipulate, model and visualise your data.</p>\n<p>This meetup will follow our usual schedule, with <strong>pizza and networking starting at 6:15PM, Prof. Wickham at 7PM, and a post-meetup reception at a nearby bar</strong>.</p>\n\n",
